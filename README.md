# calculator_project


this project started on 9/20 evening, on average, worked 2.5 hours every night, so in total it took abour 7.5 hours.

Due to the time limits, there are one thing which hasn't been implemented yet, i will keep working on them 
and will let you know when i am done with them
 (1) data validation is not done completely: parenthese validation not complete 

For now, the calculator can do:
  1. single operator calculation, e.g. +,-,*,/ for both integer and decimal numbers
     2345+1234, 23.45+45.345
  2. mixed operators calculation, e.g. + and -, + and /, + and * and / and -,etc for both integer and decimal numbers
     2+3/4+5, 2-4*6+2
  3. with parentheses calculation, e.g. 2*(3+4*5)+6, for both integer and decimal numbers
    
  
  
Exisiting bugs:
  1. parenthese calculation:  exisiting bug which is when the value inside parenthese is negative, then it fails
  2. since validation is not done yet, so for parenthese calculation, there are some non-valid format still allowed

Needs to imporve:
 UI, interaction as well as aesthetics... 
 
 
Thoughts:
   Life is not complete without libraries.... LOL
