# calculator_project


this project started on 9/20 evening, on average, worked 2.5 hours every night, so in total it took abour 7.5 hours.

Due to the time limits, there are one thing which hasn't been implemented yet
 (1) data validation is not done completely: parenthese validation not complete 

For now, the calculator can do:
  1. single operator calculation, e.g. +,-,*,/ for both integer and decimal numbers
     2345+1234, 23.45+45.345
  2. mixed operators calculation, e.g. + and -, + and /, + and * and / and -,etc for both integer and decimal numbers
     2+3/4+5, 2-4*6+2
  3. with parentheses calculation, e.g. 2*(3+4*5)+6, for both integer and decimal numbers
    
  
  
Exisiting bugs:
  1. since validation is not done yet, so for parenthese calculation, there are some non-valid format still allowed
