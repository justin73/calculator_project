# calculator_project


this project started on 9/20 evening, on average, worked 2.5 hours every night, so in total it took abour 7.5 hours.

For now, the calculator can do:

  1. single operator calculation
  2. mixed operators calculation
  3. with parentheses calculation
    
Exisiting bugs:
  1. there may be some input validation not covered.
Limits:
