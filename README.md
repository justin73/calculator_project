# calculator_project


this project started on 9/20 evening, on average, worked 2.5 hours every night, so in total it took abour 7.5 hours.

For now, the calculator can do:
  1. single operator calculation, e.g. +,-,*,/ for both integer and decimal numbers
     2345+1234, 23.45+45.345
  2. mixed operators calculation, e.g. + and -, + and /, + and * and / and -,etc for both integer and decimal numbers
     2+3/4+5, 2-4*6+2
  3. with parentheses calculation, e.g. 2*(3+4*5)+6, for both integer and decimal numbers
    
  
  
Exisiting bugs:
  1. there may be some input validation not covered. 
  2. only allows one layer of parenthese for now.
